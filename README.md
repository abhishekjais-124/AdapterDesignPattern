# AdapterDesignPattern
LLD for Adapter Design Pattern

This functions as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. We can think of an interpreter, sitting between two people having a conversation in different languages (a common problem in programming!), or a simple plug adapter that allows you to charge your US phone in any country. By enabling objects to communicate in a way that they both understand, the adapter pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

Ex - A converter(adapter) for weighing machine that is required to display weight in kgs instead of pound.
